# 📘 Our Solution for Semantic PDF Section Retrieval

This solution offers an **automated, offline system** to extract the **most relevant sections** from a collection of PDF documents, guided by a **user-defined persona** and a **job-to-be-done**. It is built for **scalability**, **accuracy**, and **modular integration**, handling multiple test cases seamlessly.

## 🔍 1. Semantic Query Formation

For each test case, we construct a **natural language query** by combining:

- 🎭 **Persona Role** (e.g., *“Marketing Manager”*)  
- 🛠️ **Job to be Done** (e.g., *“Identify innovative strategies”*)

This query acts as a **semantic lens** through which we analyze document content.

## 🧠 2. Semantic Matching via Transformers

We utilize the all-MiniLM-L6-v2 model from sentence-transformers to convert:

- The constructed **query**
- All **extracted PDF headings**

...into **dense vector embeddings**.  
We then calculate **cosine similarity** between these embeddings to rank the **most semantically relevant headings**.

## 🗂️ 3. PDF Heading Extraction with Context

Using **PyPDF2**, we apply robust heuristics to extract headings based on:

- Text formatting (🔠 uppercase, title case)
- Structural patterns (e.g., \"1."\, \"A."\)
- Line length thresholds

Additionally, for each heading, we capture the **immediate next line** as a **contextual subsection snippet**, enriching the semantic value.

## 📦 4. Structured JSON Output

For each test case, we generate a clean, machine-readable JSON output containing:

- **Metadata**: Persona, Job-to-be-Done, Document list
- **Extracted Sections**:  
  - Section titles  
  - Page numbers  
  - Importance ranking
- **Subsection Snippets**:  
  - Short paragraphs under top headings for deeper insight

✅ This output is ready for integration into **dashboards**, **search systems**, or **automated pipelines**.

---

## ⚙️ 5. Offline-Ready, Robust, and Scalable

- 🚫 **Offline Execution**: No internet required; model is pre-cached in \pp/model/\
- 📁 **Batch Processing**: Handles multiple document collections simultaneously
- 🧱 **Error Handling**: Gracefully skips unreadable or missing PDFs without halting execution

---

> This solution is built to be **fast**, **robust**, and **semantically intelligent**, making it ideal for enterprise-scale document understanding tasks.
